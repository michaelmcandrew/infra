# Setting up the control machine

1. Download and run the initialisation script:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelmcandrew/infra/master/ansible/init-control-machine.sh
bash init-control-machine.sh
```
2. Populate the `ansible/vault` directory with appropriate keys, credentials, passwords, etc.
3. Start rebuilding the infrastructure. [TODO]
